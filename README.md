### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ofir and I'm a CS student at The Open University Of Israel.                                 
solving problems with code is my mental workouts ðŸ˜„                                                 
There is somthing greater then solving problems with a machine??
I don't think so...

And what about you?

     if(Machine.isCoolerThen(visitor.getName()))
     {
        visitor.getOut();
     }
     else \\I'm looking forward to hear from you :)
        visitor.sayHi("Hi Ofir! My name is %s, here is my email: %s.\n",
                       visitor.getName(),visitor.getMail());
