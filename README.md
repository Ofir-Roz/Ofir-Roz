### Hi everyone 👋
My name is Ofir, and I'm a CS student at The Open University of Israel.                                 
Solving problems with code is my mental workout 😄                                                 

     if(Machine.isCoolerThen(visitor.getName()))
     {
        visitor.getOut();
     }
     else \\I'm looking forward to hearing from you :)
        visitor.sayHi("Hi Ofir! My name is %s, here is my email: %s.\n",
                       visitor.getName(),visitor.getMail());
